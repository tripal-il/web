# Tripal - Your In-Pocket Transportation Pal!

**⏳ Work in progress ⏳**

This app is built using data from OpenMobility's Israel GTFS, sourced from the Ministry of Transport and Road Safety (Israel). The goal of Tripal is to provide users with seamless transportation information within Israel. While this initial version focuses on local data, I plan to extend support to multiple countries in the future.
